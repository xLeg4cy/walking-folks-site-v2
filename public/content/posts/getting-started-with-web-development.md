# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skill. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and tools you need to begin your journey.

## The Basics

Every web developer should start with these three fundamental technologies:

1. HTML - Structure
2. CSS - Styling
3. JavaScript - Interactivity

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every webpage. It provides the basic structure and content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings your HTML to life with colors, layouts, and animations.

### JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your websites.

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, you can move on to:

- Frontend frameworks like React
- Backend development
- Database management
- Version control with Git

Remember, the key to success in web development is constant practice and learning.
